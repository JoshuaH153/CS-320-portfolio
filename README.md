How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

To make sure my code does what it's supposed to and keeps everything safe, I test it out thoroughly and look for any issues that could cause problems. I also spend time reviewing user requirements  to understand exactly what they want the software to do. Once I have a good idea of their needs, I carefully plan how the software will function, making sure it addresses all their requirements and solves the problem they're facing.
